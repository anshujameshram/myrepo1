Online Employee Recruitment System
Abstract:
Project Details: 
 The project entitled “Online Recruitment System” is assignedby the organization.The aim is to provide services to both the Employer and theGraduate by recruiting Graduates
 according to the employerspecifications. The main flow of the project goes as follows.

 The three main users involved in this system are1.Graduate2.Employer3.Administrator

Graduate is the one who is looking for a job in the sameorganization who can be either a fresher or an experienced.

Employer is a resource of the organization who specifies therequirements. From each department only one authorizedperson acts as an employer.

Administrator is also a resource of the organization from HRdepartment. He/she acts as a mediator between the employerand the graduate.

Graduate gives the complete details about his/her Personal,Educational and Skills which can be updated accordingly untila valid period of three months.

Whenever there is a vacancy, the employer comes into playby specifying the requirements which are viewed by theregistered graduate.

Administrator is responsible to intimate the eligible studentsfor that particular post through e-mail and also updates theemployee database according to the instructions given by 
theemployer after the complete process of interview.

 
Existing System:
 
 The company recruits graduates by maintaining manual recordswhich involves many loop holes.
Drawbacks:
1. Redundancy:
Manual records tend to contain data which are redundant. This isbecause Normalization followed is consistent data base is missingfeature in manual records.
2. Inconsistency:
Because of redundant data, there is no consistency in the data.
3. Time Consuming:
Maintaining each students and employees data with muchnumber of fields is a tedious process and takes more time to retrieveback.
4. Improper Validation:
There are many cases where validation is to be performedbetween the existing data and yet to be entered data. Also, a graduatewho appears for the interview and fails to succeed should 
not bereconsidered until a period of 3 months.
5. Tedious:
An organization data base goes through many numbers of updates each day which is hard to maintain in registers.
6. More HR:
In order to maintain the information of all the employees andstudents who applied for different jobs a special group of employeesshould be hired, which ultimately tends to the waste of 
resources
